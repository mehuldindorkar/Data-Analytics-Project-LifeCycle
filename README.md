# Introduction
The Data Analytics Project Lifecycle is the structured process followed to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can guide decision-making.
This lifecycle ensures that each step ‚Äî from defining the problem to delivering the final report ‚Äî is systematic, repeatable, and accurate.




üõ† Stages of the Data Analytics Lifecycle
1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition
Clearly define the business problem or objective.

Identify what questions need answers and the expected outcomes.

Example: "What factors influence Airbnb rental prices in New York?"

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Gather relevant data from internal databases, APIs, or public datasets.

Data can be structured (tables, CSV) or unstructured (text, images).

Example: Download Airbnb listings dataset from Kaggle.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formats.

Remove irrelevant features and normalize data for uniformity.

Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel, Power Query

Example: Convert date formats to YYYY-MM-DD, remove outliers in pricing.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform descriptive statistics and visualize trends.

Identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in data.

Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, Tableau

Example: Price trends across different locations.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling / Analysis
Apply statistical models, predictive modeling, or business logic.

For predictive analytics, use regression, classification, clustering, etc.

Example: Regression model to predict rental prices based on property features.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
Represent findings using charts, dashboards, and interactive visuals.

Use the right type of visualization for the right insight.

Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Python Visualization Libraries

7Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Reporting
Translate findings into actionable insights for decision-makers.

Provide recommendations backed by data.

Example: Suggest optimal pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Monitoring (Optional for Ongoing Projects)
Deploy dashboards or models to production environments.

Monitor performance and update as needed.
